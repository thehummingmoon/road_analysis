ANALYSIS:
1. Total Number of Vehicles Trend: Trends and patterns can be observed by examining the line graph that illustrates the total number of vehicles over time. It can assist in locating times when there might be less cars on the road, which might point to modifications in traffic patterns or other elements.
2. Accident Causes: According to my dashboard, accidents usually include two vehicles colliding, are caused by bad weather, and happen largely in urban locations around Day 6. Understanding the typical elements that lead to accidents such as the amount of traffic in urban areas and the effect of weather on road safety requires having this knowledge.
3. Casualty Distribution: It's important to note that most accidents include two casualties, however some involve more than two. This might point to a typical situation in which there are a typical number of casualties from a collision between two vehicles, although accidents with a greater death toll might be less common but still have a substantial impact.
4. Police Records: It is crucial, in my opinion, that the police keep a record of every accident that occurs at the specified site. By guaranteeing that the information encompasses a wide range of incidents, it offers a more precise image of the region's traffic safety problems.
I've been able to find areas for improvement in traffic management or safety measures, as well as obtain insights into patterns in road safety, by analyzing these elements and visualizing them in my Power BI dashboard.
